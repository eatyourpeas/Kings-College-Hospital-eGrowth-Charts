Kings-College-Hospital-eGrowth-Charts
=====================================

<b>Plot children's growth data against national UK90 and UK-WHO standards and report standard deviation scores and centiles.</b>
<p>
The software contains T-SQL database tables and methods. It contains the UK90 and UK-WHO growth standards for children (height, weight, BMI and head circumference). These data and the LMS method on which they are based are subject to licence by the MRC and this can be obtained from the MRC (see details below).
</p>
<p>
It calculates a corrected decimal age from a date of birth, measurement date and gestational age (based on RCPCH standards) and uses this to generate L, M and S values by interpolation from reference data. These are converted to SDS and centiles.
Values are reported to Microsoft Report Builder generated .rdl charts.

<h3>Applying for an MRC Licence</h3>
</P>
King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust have developed electronic growth charts for use with SQL databases. They calculate decimal ages, calendar ages (both corrected and chronological) as well as centiles and standard deviation scores for height, weight, BMI, head circumference and blood pressure. They also plot the values on ReportBuilder reports. We are happy to share this work on request. We accept no liability for the accuracy or stability of the charts.
 
The data tables which the charts use (and are included)  however are subject to licence by the Medical Research Council and cannot be released until evidence of this is provided. The data this pertains to is the UK90 and WHO data for height, weight, BMI, head circumference and blood pressure and was produced using the ‘LMS method’ devised by Professor Tim Cole. Licences can received on request from the MRC on the address below.
